The whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. It‚Äôs not the thickest I‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. Given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.)

There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes,4.1,"6,753"

This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given.

Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6.

Cover quality is very nice.2. Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness. Also screen color and touch response feels premium.3. Battery life is very impressive with 1.5 day backup with normal use.4. 80 watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within 30 to 35 minutes.5. I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt 9 which runs very smooth.I think it'll play heavy games smoothly. So it perform well.6. I am new to use Oxygen OS. I feels OS premium and smooth without adds.7. Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update.8. No heating issue.9.

The company taking around 39k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below 20k. If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model don't go for this model because of the brand.

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that,3.8,"17,833"

This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.,4.1,"3,13,832"

Of you are a heavy user then don't consider this phone.Cons:-1. Slow charging (this phone usually takes around 2 hours for full charge)2. In initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption I.e it runs 1.5 -2 days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal3. You will not get features like slow motion etc etc. In this price range you can get these feature on other phone Or MI variantsThis is my 15 days reviewHence I haven't tried every feature of the phoneWill come back soon after using it for months,3.9,"2,180"

Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,4.3,"9,499"

Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,4.3,"9,499"

B098R25TGC,Noise Buds VS201 V2 in-Ear Truly Wireless Earbuds with Dual Equalizer | with Mic | Total 14-Hour Playtime | Full Touch Control | IPX5 Water Resistance and Bluetooth v5.1 (Olive Green),Electronics,In-Ear,"‚Çπ1,299","‚Çπ2,999",57%,AE5VN6K6A4NJNWVYSEWB62MA3GMA,Karthik,RXB5KHLQUXONP,[Updated] decent tws for under 1k,"[Updated]  Overall you really get what you pay for. They serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening. Main problem I noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason. Once or twice I had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it paired.If you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesn't work. This is starting to get annoying but maybe I'll get used to it. We'll see.----------------------------------------------------------This is just day 1 review of these. Got them for Rs 898 on some offer on Amazon. I'll post updates later on. Hope this is helpful for anyone interested.Package : The packaging is quite decent for such a low price. Comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case. Also included are a very short USB c cable and two additional earplugs - small and large. Package includes some Noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.Build : was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. Will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. The earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. They fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.Comfort : This is very subjective and each ear is different. It's one of the reaonss I wanted to get a cheap tws to see if I'm OK with the form factor for long hours. The prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so I switched to the small size ones. And after about 20 mins I forgot I was even wearing them. The earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they don't cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. One thing to note is that if you have ""Gandhi"" ears then the fit might be a little awkward - I should know. My ears covered the touch areas of the buds so I had to fiddle around a bit if I wanted to do any of the touch actions. YMMV.Sound quality : I liked them. I'm no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. I tried my usual test at https://youtu.be/J0a2Prc_MQo and they fared quite well. The treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. There was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the L and R drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. I feel this definitely punches above its price point.Call quality : In a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. There was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. But things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like you're inside a well. Seems the mics can't figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. Overall you get what you pay for here.Range : max I got was around 5m. Not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised. Any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so I guess that's passable.Pairing :------ UPDATE on 12th Aug 2022  - - - - - -Major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. You have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. Had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.Have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.---------------I don't have a phone to test the fast pair features - Actually I'm not even sure these support it.

I bought them 4 or 5 years ago and there are various issues with them. Wanted to buy this Qubo camera and give it a try as this is Made in India and from the famous Hero Group. The product did live up to my expectation!!Here are my observations:Pros:- Excellent in performance.- Accurate in motion detection.- Can connect anytime from anywhere if the camera is connected to the internet.- LED turns red when there is no internet connectivity.- Crystal clear vision even in night.Cons:- Had to struggle a bit in configuring it. The usability of the app is not easy to understand. Figured out the right options to use after few trials. Hence giving 4 star rating.- The LED doesn't glow green when it is recording though the option is turned on.Keep it up Hero Group and looking forward to more such great products from your organization!!,4.1,"3,606"

The coverage never dropped and was mostly consistent.However it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet. Apparently the Ethernet port got damaged somehow. I tried calling TP Link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is. It's the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a year's usage. And to make it worse there's dismal after sales service.I tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasn't stable. I think I'll finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers. Hopefully I'll find a good maker .,4.4,"12,679"

The installation process was smooth apart from the fact that one needs to purchase a 16A three-pin socket (wall plug not included with the water heater). There are no installation charges and my only gripe with the water heater is no plug!!The water heats up very quickly (5 mins approx.) and retains temperature for good 4 hours. Light indicators show heat stages (Heating or Heated) Even though one will find many alternatives at better prices additional costs for installation and accessories should be taken into account.Bonus marks for getting the design correct.,4.3,"11,924"

You can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom... Also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed :((( And even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse... Onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside... I'm really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stove...There is one positive side and that is that heating is quick. My pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly. Faster than on gas stove. Also you can set time for like 10 minut and leave it which is quite convenient...Controll is easy. But I hate details. First I love one detail. There is ""pause"" button which is very cool. If something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat - It is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off",4.2,"39,724"

Here you just press pause again and cook as before... But that is only thing that I love. Otherwise I hate how it is designed.... First basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless. Those buttons are preset temperatures. But anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook... Like there is 'stirr fry' button and it set 180C. It totally burns onion... I set usually 180C for beginning and then soon change for 160C. But even 160C is too much burning... But lower setting is only 130C which is not frying at all. I would need like 150C I guess and it is impossible to set :((( ...Also I noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses. It heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like 10 seconds starts again. So instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and off.But back to controll. Except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it won't let you or let you to do only one '-' but not 2 times '-'. Why??? I don't know probably ill will... You need to first press ""manual"" button which change temperature completely to 130C and only then you can freely press +/- and set your desired temperature. So basically I never use any preset mode and I always only press 'manual' and +/- to set my temperature...Another control is setting time. I must say satting time is useful feature and I love it",4.2,"39,724"

Else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating (I haven't tested this though).  These are mentioned in the manual.  So this can be thought of as a warmer + boiler.  So you CANNOT leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil.  I assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that manner.Accessories: Cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided.

I was not aware of the process that you can't have it like the normal coffee so I tried it like normal one and it failed miserably because the coffee seeds won't get dissolved there is no coffee smell in it. Then I went online to understand the process where I came to know about this coffee maker. I bought it for 2cup coffee which cost me 299/-. You can get bigger one also for 4 or 6 cup. You can go through the process of how to make south Indian filter coffee online. To me it does job very efficiently and finally I am able to have a good cup of filter coffee. Now about the product it's not premium quality steel but it's a decent one and it's very easy to use. You fill the filter in morning and you can have the raw extract till night. So to me it's a value for money if you want to try filter coffee.,4.1,693
